# AAM Large Upload (<=1.2GB)

Uploads MUST NOT be proxied through Next.js memory.
Use S3/MinIO presigned uploads (multipart if needed).

## Requirements
- Validate size <= 1.2GB and allowed mime/ext before issuing presigned URL(s)
- Persist UploadBlob metadata with expires_at
- UI uploads directly to object storage
- After upload completes: enqueue processing job for meeting_id
