# AAM Definition of Done (per task)

A task is DONE only when:
- Code compiles/lints
- RBAC checked (if endpoint touches meetings)
- Status transitions are correct (if pipeline touched)
- Cleanup rule respected (UploadBlob immediate delete on success, TTL on failure)
- memory-bank updated if architecture/db/api changed
