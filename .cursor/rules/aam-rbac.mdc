# AAM RBAC

## Meeting access
- Read: owner + viewers + Admin
- Validate Accept/Reject: ONLY current owner
- Share/Revoke/Transfer: ONLY current owner

## Transfer ownership
- After transfer, ONLY new owner can validate.
- Keep viewers unless explicitly changed.

## Admin access
- Admin can manage users, meeting types, scenarios.
- Admin is NOT implicitly owner of meetings.
